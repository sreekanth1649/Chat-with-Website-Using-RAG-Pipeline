# Chat-with-Website-Using-RAG-Pipeline

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that enables conversational interaction with data extracted from websites. By leveraging state-of-the-art web scraping, embedding, and natural language processing techniques, the system transforms structured and unstructured web content into an intelligent queryable system.

The key objective is to extract information from websites, process it into searchable embeddings, and use a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide contextually accurate and user-friendly responses to natural language queries. This pipeline is ideal for use cases like research assistance, competitive analysis, content exploration, and knowledge management.

Features
Web Data Extraction
Automatically crawls and scrapes content from user-provided websites.
Extracts both structured data (tables, lists, metadata) and unstructured content (paragraphs, articles, etc.).
Embeddings and Vector Store

Converts web content into vector embeddings using a pre-trained transformer model.
Efficiently stores embeddings in a vector database for similarity-based retrieval.
Interactive Question-Answering

Users can ask natural language questions related to the extracted website data.
Provides accurate, contextual, and structured responses using an LLM.
Comparison Queries

Supports multi-source comparisons by aggregating and analyzing data from multiple websites.
Generates comparison outputs in clear and concise formats, such as tables or bullet points.
Dynamic Updates

Reusable pipeline for scraping and embedding new websites as needed.
How It Works
1. Data Ingestion
Input: User provides a list of website URLs.
Process:
Crawl and scrape website content using tools like BeautifulSoup or selenium.
Extract textual data, metadata, and relevant fields from the website.
Break the content into smaller, meaningful chunks for efficient retrieval.
Generate embeddings for these chunks using HuggingFace's sentence-transformers model.
Store embeddings and metadata in a FAISS vector database for similarity-based searches.
2. Query Handling
Input: A natural language query from the user.
Process:
Convert the query into an embedding using the same model used for website content.
Search the vector database for chunks similar to the query.
Retrieve the most relevant content based on similarity scores.
3. Response Generation
Input: Retrieved content chunks and the user query.
Process:
Use the retrieved content and query as input to the LLM.
Generate a detailed, context-aware response, ensuring factuality and clarity.
Format the response appropriately (e.g., structured paragraphs, tables, bullet points).
